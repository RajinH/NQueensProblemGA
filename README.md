# NQueensProblemGA
Genetic Algorithm implemented in Unity 3D to solve the N-Queens Problem, a combinatorial optimisation problem. The GA utilises 2 different crossover methods (PBX and PPX) and has an experimentation mode for data collection about the GA model's performances with different crossover methods.
